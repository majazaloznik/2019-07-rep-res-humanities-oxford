* Create new repo on github, clone to local, start new Rstudio project using standard template. 
* clean up makefile and get it to work!
* missing packages, manage to install V8 (via `yay -S v8-3.14-bin`) and DiagrammeRsvg
* `make dot` throws error though: "fatal error in ../src/platform-linux.cc, line 782", "CHECK-EQ(0,result) failed. Expected: 0 Found:22
* OK, looks like there is an issue with how I've installed V8 on this laptop, seems that DiagrammeRsvg---although installed ok--doensn't actually work. 
* So I'll remove the dot.png from the makefile, that's the only place it is used anyway.. 
* to demo the idea i can still use an old example. 
* oh, wow actually there's a command called `dot` in shell that does about 7 steps of my old R script in one. I've changed to that!
* OK, this now works, I need to update the template! todo. 
So this is what my makefile looks like graphically at the minute:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(rprojroot::find_root("Makefile"),"/docs/presentations/figures/make.png"))
```

OK, now let's have a look at `packrat`. 

* run packrat::init()
* initialization complete!

Oh dear lord, couldn't get one of the images (phd comics) to register the out.widht parameter.. turns out [https://github.com/yihui/knitr/issues/1477] that you need to set both height and width if the image is too small. Works now.
* OK, keep writing notes
* actually makes more sense to just go straight to the presentation. Copy outline from teh SAGE one in March.
* run with xaringan
* this means updating makefile as well, with rmd2xari command. 
* todo: update the template. 
* OK, preparing slides and writing notes, and it turns out - i've had this problem before i think - that when i have too many notes for a slide, i cannot read them anymore, they disappear off the screen. The solution is to break it up into several slides that seemingly overlay, so look like incremental bullets. 
* error in `papers$key` was produced because i once forgot to pu thte bibliography argument in the `Cite()` call, and took me forever to figure out. 
* try to get small font so i'd be able to fit all references on one page, but seems too complicated right now. looks liek requires my-theme.css, but not sure where to put it.. todo. 
* make qr code for repo for last page
* change two column setup in css by copying the whole default one to my-css, and placing it in the same folder as the .Rmd file.

* packrat seems to automatically update my .gitignore file and delete /packrat/src/ which i am trying to ignore. this is fixed by going into packrat.opts and changing `vcs.ignore.src: TRUE`
* sth bad happened with the fonts. maybe because i'm offline? hopefully!
* Instructions for github pages: 
* copy intex.htlm file into `docs` folder, and change the link address. follow the pattern i.e. the `docs` folder is skipped. careful!there will be no error if you get this wrong.. 
* Then go to the github repo and setup github pages: Settings - Github Pages- source: master branch/docs folder
* but i think this only works if the figures are in the same folder? 
* wait a second and see. 
* oh, also commit and push first haha
* todo: add instructions for githubpages to mz!
* also if pages don't work right away, because you fucked up, go back to settings and turn them off and back on, that usually helps a bit!
* I'll just move the figures now to save time later?
