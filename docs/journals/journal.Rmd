# Monday 22.7.2019

* Create new repo on github, clone to local, start new Rstudio project using standard template. 
* clean up makefile and get it to work!
* missing packages, manage to install V8 (via `yay -S v8-3.14-bin`) and DiagrammeRsvg
* `make dot` throws error though: "fatal error in ../src/platform-linux.cc, line 782", "CHECK-EQ(0,result) failed. Expected: 0 Found:22
* OK, looks like there is an issue with how I've installed V8 on this laptop, seems that DiagrammeRsvg---although installed ok--doensn't actually work. 
* So I'll remove the dot.png from the makefile, that's the only place it is used anyway.. 
* to demo the idea i can still use an old example. 
* oh, wow actually there's a command called `dot` in shell that does about 7 steps of my old R script in one. I've changed to that!
* OK, this now works, I need to update the template!
So this is what my makefile looks like graphically at the minute:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(rprojroot::find_root("Makefile"),"/figures/make.png"))
```

OK, now let's have a look at `packrat`. 
* run packrat::init()
* initialization complete!
